;; This package provides major modes for editing OpenFOAM data files
;; and C++ code.  There are also user commands for managing OpenFOAM
;; case directories.
;;
;; By default, verbatim text blocks in OpenFOAM data files are
;; indented like data which yields acceptable results for C++ code.
;; As an alternative, you can install the Polymode package from MELPA
;; stable.  Polymode provides multiple major mode support for editing
;; C++ code in verbatim text blocks.  OpenFOAM requires Polymode 0.2
;; or newer.  To actually enable Polymode, customize the variable
;; ‘openfoam-verbatim-text-mode’.
