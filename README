An Emacs major mode for editing OpenFOAM data files; and user
commands for OpenFOAM case directories.


* Installation

Copy file ‘openfoam.el’ and ‘openfoam-autoloads.el’ into a
directory in your Emacs load path.  Optionally byte-compile
‘openfoam.el’.  Then add the following code to your Emacs
initialization file:

     (require 'openfoam-autoloads)

See file ‘init.el’ for my personal settings.
